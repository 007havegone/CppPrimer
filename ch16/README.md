Chapter 16. Templates and Generic Programming
=============================================

Exercise 16.1:
--------------

> Define instantiation.

Class or function generated by the compiler from a template.

Exercise 16.2:
--------------

> Write and test your own versions of the `compare` functions.

[compare](ex16_02_compare.h)

Exercise 16.3:
--------------

> Call your `compare` function on two `Sales_data` objects to see how your compiler handles errors during instantiation.

```sh
error C2678: binary '<': no operator found which takes a left-hand operand of type 'const Sales_data' (or there is no acceptable conversion)
```

Exercise 16.4:
--------------

> Write a template that acts like the library `find` algorithm. The function will need two template type parameters, one to represent the function’s iterator parameters and the other for the type of the value. Use your function to find a given value in a `vector<int>` and in a `list<string>`.

[Find](ex16_04_find.h)

Exercise 16.5:
--------------

> Write a template version of the `print` function from 6.2.4 (p. 217) that takes a reference to an array and can handle arrays of any size and any element type.

[print](ex16_05_print_array.h)

Exercise 16.6:
--------------

> How do you think the library `begin` and `end` functions that take an array argument work? Define your own versions of these functions.

[begin and end](ex16_06_begin_end.h)

Exercise 16.7:
--------------

> Write a `constexpr` template that returns the size of a given array.

[SizeOfArray](ex16_07_sizeof_array.h)

Exercise 16.8:
--------------

> In the “Key Concept” box on page 108, we noted that as a matter of habit C++ programmers prefer using != to using <. Explain the rationale for this habit.

As we’ve seen, only a few library types, `vector` and `string` being among them, have the subscript operator. Similarly, all of the library containers have iterators that define the `==` and `!=` operators. Most of those iterators do not have the `<` operator. By routinely using iterators and `!=`, we don’t have to worry about the precise type of container we’re processing.
