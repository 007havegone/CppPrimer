//! Exercise 10.20:
//! The library defines an algorithm named count_if. Like find_if, this function takes
//! a pair of iterators denoting an input range and a predicate that it applies to each
//! element in the given range. count_if returns a count of how often the predicate is
//! true. Use count_if to rewrite the portion of our program that counted how many words
//! are greater than length 6.
//!
//! Exercise 10.21:
//! Write a lambda that captures a local int variable and decrements that variable until
//! it reaches 0. Once the variable is 0 additional calls should no longer decrement the
//! variable. The lambda should return a bool that indicates whether the captured variable is 0.
//!
