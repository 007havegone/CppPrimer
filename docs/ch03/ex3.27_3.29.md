##Exercise 3.27>Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no argumentsand returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal?Explain why.```cppunsigned buf_size = 1024;int ia[buf_size];   // legalint ia[4 * 7 - 14]; // legalint ia[txt_size()]; // legalchar st[11] = "fundamental";  // illegal, the string's size is 12.```##Exercise 3.28>What are the values in the following arrays?```cppstring sa[10];int ia[10];int main() {  string sa2[10];  int ia2[10];}```please see 2.2.1. Variable Definitions -> Default Initialization.`std::string` isn't a build-in type. The initializer will set it empty.`ia` and `ia2` are build-type. But `ia` isn't in the function body, so itwill be initalized to **zero**. `ia2` is in the function body. so it'svalue is **undefined**.You can also use gdb to debug the value when the code is running.##Exercise 3.29:>List some of the drawbacks of using an array instead of a vector.1. can't add elements to an array.2. can't use auto to deduce the type from a list of initalizers.3. no arrays of references.4. can't use template and iterator.5. vector have lots of useful methods and algorithms.
