##Exercise 3.12>Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error?For those that are legal, explain what the definition does.For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.```cppvector<vector<int>> ivec;         // legal(c++11), vectors.vector<string> svec = ivec;       // illegal, different type.vector<string> svec(10, "null");  // legal, vector have 10 strings: "null".```##Exercise 3.13>How many elements are there in each of the followingvectors? What are the values of the elements?```cppvector<int> v1;         // size:0,  no values.vector<int> v2(10);     // size:10, value:0vector<int> v3(10, 42); // size:10, value:42vector<int> v4{10};     // size:1,  value:10vector<int> v5{10, 42}; // size:2,  value:10, 42vector<string> v6{10};  // size:10, value:""vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};  // size:10, value:"hi"```
