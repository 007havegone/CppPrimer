##Exercise 3.12>Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error?For those that are legal, explain what the definition does.For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.- (a) vector<vector<int>> ivec;         // legal(c++11), vectors.- (b) vector<string> svec = ivec;       // illegal, different type.- (c) vector<string> svec(10, "null");  // legal, vector have 10 strings: "null".##Exercise 3.13>How many elements are there in each of the followingvectors? What are the values of the elements?- (a) vector<int> v1;         // size:0,  value:0- (b) vector<int> v2(10);     // size:10, value:0- (c) vector<int> v3(10, 42); // size:10, value:42- (d) vector<int> v4{10};     // size:1,  value:10- (e) vector<int> v5{10, 42}; // size:2,  value:10, 42- (f) vector<string> v6{10};  // size:10, value:""- (g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};  // size:10, value: "hi"
