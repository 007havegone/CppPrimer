##Exercise 3.3>Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the stringinput operator and in the getline function.The `getline` function takes an input stream and a string.This function reads the given stream up to and including the first newline and stores what it read—not includingthe newline—in its string argument.After getline sees a newline, even if it is the first character in the input,it stops reading and returns.If the first character in the input is a newline,then the resulting string is the empty string.`getline` function whitespace handling,do not ignore the beginning of the line blank characters read charactersuntil it encounters a line break,read to termination and discard newline(line breaks removed from the input stream  but is not stored in the string object).[Read more](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/getline/)
