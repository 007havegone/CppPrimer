- Use `-std=c++11`(optional: `-pedantic -Wall`) flag when compiling.(or you can use Visual Studio 2012+)
- I don't know the standard answer, but I tried my best to keep the correctness, if you found any bug, please [tell me](https://github.com/Mooophy/Cpp-Primer/issues/new), thanks.
- I have downloaded the headers from this book's [web site](http://www.informit.com/store/c-plus-plus-primer-9780321714114) and put them in the `include` folder.
